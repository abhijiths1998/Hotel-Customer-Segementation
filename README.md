# Hotel-Customer-Segementation

### Context
This real-world customer dataset with 31 variables describes 83,590 instances (customers) from a hotel in Lisbon, Portugal.

### Content
The data comprehends three full years of customer personal, behavioral, demographic, and geographical information.

### Acknowledgements
Additional information on this dataset can be found in the article A Hotel's customers personal, behavioral, demographic, and geographic dataset from Lisbon, Portugal (2015-2018), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief (online November 2020).

### Inspiration
This dataset can be used in data mining, machine learning, and other analytical field problems in the scope of data science. Due to its unit of analysis, it is a dataset especially suitable for building customer segmentation models, including clustering and RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) models, but also be used in classification and regression problems.

### Problem Statement
  * Our aim is to segment the incoming customer based on the features in dataset using clustering 
  * Understand the labels created based on the clustering labels
  * Use the labels for modelling and prediction
  * Interpret the models and find the limitations
### Skills used
  * Data Understanding 
  * Data analysis using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn
  * Clustering using KMeans clustering,Elbow plot
  * Modelling using standalone and ensemble algorithms
  * Metrics focused to improve upon : F1-weighted
